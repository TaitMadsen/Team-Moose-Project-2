====================

Repository for the second project in CSC 212, fall 2013

The project is split into two branches, website and app. 

The app already has a readme attached to it. 

For the website,
1. Github Scans: Contains few of the paper prototypes that we initially came up with.

2. Final Design Prototypes: Contains the ppt which accurately describes the final website that we planned to achieve when 
   we started to implement it. 
   
3. HTML Design Prototypes; Contains the inital website designs. Does not have much funcionality.

4. HTML site Moose: Contains the final website.
